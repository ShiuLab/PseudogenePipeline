--> August, 1999

Corrected problem with opt_cut initialization that only appeared
with p?compfa programs.

--> v3.26	July, 1999

pvcomp* programs now use the same method for working with forward and
reverse strands as the standard fast*3(_t) programs.  Thus, statistics
for DNA sequences should be very similar for pvcompfa and fasta3 or
fasta3_t.

 		February, 1999

With release fasta32t02 of the FASTA package, the alignment
routines for pvcompfa, pvcompsw, etc now work properly
again.

The PVM versions of the FASTA and Smith-Waterman search programs
should now be functionally identical to the multithreaded (fasta3_t,
ssearch3_t) and non-threaded (fasta3, ssearch3) versions.

The programs have also been updated to provide similar -m 10
information to the non-pvm versions.  There are some slight
differences, because the pvcomp* versions are designed to work with
multiple sequences.  But, in general, a script that looks for /^>>>/
to start an alignment set and /^>>><<</ to end the set work work
properly.

--> v3.23	March, 1999 

Modified Makefile.pvm, showsum.c so that showsum.c is used by
both the complib/_thr and pvcomplib (pvm parallel) versions.

Corrected bug in reading first query for DNA sequences.

--> v3.25	May, 1999

Fixed pvm_showalign.c so that FIRSTNODE (in msg.h) can be 1, rather
than 0.  #define FIRSTNODE 1 is recommended when the virtual machine
has 8 or more nodes.
