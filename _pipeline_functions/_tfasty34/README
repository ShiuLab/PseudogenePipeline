Up to date release notes are available in the file readme.v34t0

Documentation on the fasta3 version programs is available in the files:

	fasta3.1	(unix man page)
	ssearch3.1	(unix man page)

	readme.v34t0	(text descriptions of bug fixes and version history)

	fasta3x.me	(unix -me nroff file)
	fasta3x.doc	(text version of fast3x.me)

The latter two files provide background information on installing the
fasta programs (in particular, the FASTLIBS file), that new users of
the fasta3 package may find useful.  Note that many non-database
searching programs are available in the fasta20 package.


Documentation on the pvm3/mpi versions of the programs is available
in:
	readme.pvm_3.4
