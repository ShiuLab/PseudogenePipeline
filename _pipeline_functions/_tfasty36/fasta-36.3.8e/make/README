fasta36/Make

================
Makefiles for different Unix/Linux/MacOS configurations

****************
These make files are designed to be run from the ../src directory, e.g.

cd ~/fasta36/src
make -f ../make/Makfile.linux64_sse2 all
****************

While several different architectures are specified here, the files
that are used the most are:

Makefile.linux64_sse2 -- standard Linux(64-bit) Makefile

 -- now equivalent to Makefile.linux64 and Makefile.linux.  For
    non-sse2 compiles, use Makefile.linux64_nosse2

Makefile.linux_icc_sse2 -- Linux (64-bit) with Intel icc compiler

Makefile.os_x86_64 -- standard MacOS (64-bit) Makefile (also sse2)

Makfile.nmk_ics -- Windows 32-bit with Intel icc compiler

================

Most of the other Makefiles have not been tested for months or years.

================================================================

The major Makefiles above include other makefiles, including
Makefile36m.common, Makefile.pcom_t, Makefile.fcom to compile and link
the appropriate programs.

The Windows Makefile.nmk_icl uses Makefile.nm_fcom and Makefile.nm_pcom

The windows environment requires Microsoft nmake.
