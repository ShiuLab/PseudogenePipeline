<p />
Currently, there are five different versions of the FASTA programs that can be downloaded from the <a href="http://faculty.virginia.edu/wrpearson/fasta">FASTA Software WWW site</a>.  I recommend that you use either <a href="fasta36/">fasta-36</a>, the very latest version, or <a href="CURRENT/">fasta-35</a>, the "classic" version that has been available for since 2007.
<p />
Here I try to explain the major differences.

<tr><th>Version</th><th>New Programs</th><th>Other changes</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="fasta36/">fasta-36</a></td><td> None </td><td>
The major improvement in FASTA v36 is the ability to calculate and
display multiple significant alignments (multiple HSP's) between a
query sequence and a library sequence.  Previous FASTA versions had
the serious shortcoming of only showing the best
alignment. A <tt>tfastx36</tt> alignment between a protein and its
exon-containing gene will show all of the exon alignments that are
long enough to be significant.
<p>
FASTA v36 also provides more flexible strategies for searching lists
of datbase files, and versions after fasta-36.2 are fully threaded, so
both searches and alignments can be distributed among multiple
processors with efficient speedup.
<p>
PVM/MPI parallel versions of FASTA v36 are under development.

</td>
<td>FASTA v35 provides significant improvements in statistical accuracy and program efficiency in threaded (multi-CPU, multi-core) environments. The program now automatically produces 500 random shuffles when small libraries are searched.  Thus, <code>prss</code> and <code>prfx</code> are no longer required; <code>ssearch35</code> and <code>fastx35</code> provide the same function.</td>

</td>
<td>FASTA v34 is the last version of the FASTA3 series before the
  significant changes introduced with FASTA v35.  The FASTA v3
  programs were first introduced in 1996, with threaded code
  for multi-processors, more accurate statistical estimates, and
  optimal Smith-Waterman alignments with <code>ssearch</code>.  More
  recent versions (v34) provided accelerated Smith-Waterman searches
  using Altivec and SSE2 vector processors. FASTA v34 is no longer
  updated for bug fixes. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan=3><hr /></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="fasta2/">fasta2</a></td>
<td><code>+lfasta</code><br /><code>+tfasta</code>
</td>
<td>FASTA v2 was introduced in 1995, improving sensitivity by
  calculated gapped alignment scores. Modern (V34 and V35) versions of
  FASTA have significantly more robust statistical estimates, threaded
  code, and vectorized Smith-Waterman, so FASTA v2 should not be used
  for database searching.  However, until <code>lalign</code> was addeed
  to FASTA v35 in March, 2007, FASTA v2 was the only source for
  the <code>lalign</code> program.  Today, the only programs provided in
  FASTA v2 that are not provided in FASTA v35 are the Kyte-Doolittle
  hydropathy plotter <code>grease</code> and the classic (though very
  inaccurate) secondary structure prediction programs <code>chofas</code>
  and <code>garnier</code></td>

<p />
The current stable version of the FASTA programs is version 35,
and older releases of version 35
are <a href="fasta3/">available</a>
to make it easier for software packagers to work with a consistent
version of the software.  However,
the <a href="CURRENT/">CURRENT</a>
version of FASTA should be used whenever possible.  Many bug reports
reflect older versions of the software.
