fasta36/doc/INSTALL

To compile the FASTA programs, change to the fasta36/src directory:

  cd ~/fasta36/src

and type:

  make -f ../make/Makefile.linux64_sse2 all

The file fasta36/make/README gives more information about the
different Makefiles available. The code is routinely compiled and
tested under Linux (64-bit, sse2) and MacOS X (64-bit, sse2).
