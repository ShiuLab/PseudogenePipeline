If you regularly install the latest version of the FASTA package from
http://faculty.virginia.edu/wrpearson/fasta, you may want to join the
fasta_list SYMPA mailing list.  I use this list to announce new
releases and solicit bug reports.

To join the mailing list, go to the WWW page at:

   lists.virginia.edu/sympa/info/fasta_list

Select the "Subscribe" option on the lower left, and at the linked
page, enter your email address, and click "submit".  You will be asked
to confirm your membership in the mailing list.
